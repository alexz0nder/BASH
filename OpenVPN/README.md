# This is a script for CentOS for automatically make all necessary moves for adding an OpenVPN user.

This script was created specially when it came to  a situation when many people decided to change his/her employer.
And to reduce a lot of hand work I decided to write this.
Of course? time will correct it. Even now I know that I still have to add:
- a way for sending an archive to a user.
- also I still didn't add a check for a "-y" argument for skipping all questions...

I sincerely hope I'll finish it in a week... :)
